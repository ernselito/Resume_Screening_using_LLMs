*Project:* Resume Screening using LLMs

*Objective:* Build a system that uses LLMs to screen resumes and match candidates with job openings.

*Task:*

1. *Data Collection:* Collect a dataset of resumes, including relevant information such as skills, experience, and education.
2. *Model Training:* Train an LLM model to extract relevant information from resumes and match candidates with job openings.
3. *Model Evaluation:* Evaluate the performance of the LLM model using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. *Deployment:* Deploy the model as a web application or API that recruiters can use to screen resumes.

*Technical Requirements:*

1. *Python:* Use Python as the programming language for the project.
2. *LLM Library:* Use a library such as Hugging Face Transformers or spaCy to work with LLMs.
3. *Data Preprocessing:* Preprocess the resume data to extract relevant information and convert it into a format that can be used by the LLM model.
4. *Model Training:* Train the LLM model using a dataset of resumes and job openings.

*Benefits for Recruiters:*

1. *Improved Efficiency:* Automate the resume screening process, saving time and effort for recruiters.
2. *Better Candidate Matching:* Use LLMs to extract relevant information from resumes and match candidates with job openings based on their skills and experience.
3. *Enhanced Candidate Experience:* Provide a more personalized and efficient experience for candidates by automating the screening process.

*Example Code:*

Here's an example code snippet using Hugging Face Transformers and Python:
import pandas as pd
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('resumes.csv')

# Preprocess data
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
X = tokenizer(df['resume_text'], return_tensors='pt', max_length=512, padding='max_length', truncation=True)
y = df['job_opening']

# Train model
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=len(set(y)))
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model.to(device)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X['input_ids'], y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
This code snippet demonstrates how to use Hugging Face Transformers to train a BERT-based model for resume screening. You can modify the code to suit your specific requirements and dataset.
